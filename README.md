## Features

- Collected data from kaggle
- Preprocess and clean the tweet data
- Perform sentiment analysis using machine learning models
- Visualize the results

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tushar040903/Twitter_sentiment_Analysis.git
2. Change the directory to the project folder

## Data Collection
The tweet data used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle dataset. Ensure you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the data directory. The dataset should be in CSV format.
Here is the link for the dataset -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140

## Model Training
The sentiment analysis model is trained using labeled tweet data. I use common NLP techniques and machine learning models like Logistic Regression. The script Twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb handles the training process.

## Results
The results of the sentiment analysis are saved in a CSV file. You can visualize the results using the visualize_results.py script to get insights into the sentiment distribution.
